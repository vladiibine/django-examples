# django-examples
Examples of django projects that include either features of either core django or other django apps.

Why?
----
Needed a place to store code more complex than snippets.

The plan
---------
Complete projects will be stored here. These will illustrate a specific feature or a comprehensive feature set.
These projects will be grouped (hopefully semantically) in different folders.
If too much boilerplate code needs to be writter, some kind of project skeleton will be used for building the "example" on top of it.
